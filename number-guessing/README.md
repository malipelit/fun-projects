# Project: Number Guessing

Guess the number that the friend computer held in his memory.

## How to Run

Just run the ```main.py``` file as below:
1. Open the terminal/command prompt
1. Type ```python main.py```
1. Set the upper bound (Don't forget, the higher the better)
1. Guess the number until you find it

## Future Developments

- holding each guess
- warning the user if an unexpected guess happens
- visualize the game
- create it with C++ / Java
